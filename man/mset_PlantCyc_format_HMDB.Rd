\title{A metabolite set (HMDB-IDs) based on PlantCyc}
\description{
A metabolite set based on PlantCyc 12.0 (https://www.plantcyc.org/).
We extracted the pathway information from the biopax-level2.owl
PlantCyc pathway IDs and HMDB IDs were extracted. This dataset
contains 714 metabolite sets linked to HMDB IDs. There are only
metabolite sets containing at least 5 compounds.

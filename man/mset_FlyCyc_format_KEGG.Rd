\title{A metabolite set (KEGG COMPOUND-IDs) based on FlyCyc}
\description{
A metabolite set based on FlyCyc version 21.5
(https://biocyc.org/FLY/organism-summary?object=FLY).
We extracted the pathway information from the biopax-level2.owl
FlyCyc pathway IDs and KEGG COMPOUND IDs were extracted. This dataset
contains 90 metabolite sets linked to KEGG COMPOUND IDs. There are only
metabolite sets containing at least 5 compounds.

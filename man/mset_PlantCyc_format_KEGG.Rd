\title{A metabolite set (KEGG COMPOUND-IDs) based on PlantCyc}
\description{
A metabolite set based on PlantCyc 12.0 (https://www.plantcyc.org/).
We extracted the pathway information from the biopax-level2.owl
PlantCyc pathway IDs and KEGG COMPOUND IDs were extracted. This dataset
contains 606 metabolite sets linked to KEGG COMPOUND IDs. There are only
metabolite sets containing at least 5 compounds.

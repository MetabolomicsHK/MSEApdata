\title{A metabolite set (HMDB-IDs) based on SMPDB core metabolic pathways}
\description{
A metabolite set based on SMPDB (http://smpdb.ca/).
We downloaded the CSV file of metabolite names that
linked to SMPDB pathways (ver. 2.0). SMPDB pathway IDs and
HMDB IDs were extracted. This dataset includes 92 core metabolic pathways.

\title{A metabolite set (KEGG COMPOUND-IDs) based on EcoCyc}
\description{
A metabolite set based on EcoCyc version 21.5
(https://ecocyc.org/).
We extracted the pathway information from the biopax-level2.owl
EcoCyc pathway IDs and KEGG COMPOUND IDs were extracted. This dataset
contains 222 metabolite sets linked to KEGG COMPOUND IDs. There are only
metabolite sets containing at least 5 compounds.

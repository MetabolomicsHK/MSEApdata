\title{A metabolite set (KEGG COMPOUND-IDs) based on AraCyc}
\description{
A metabolite set based on AraCyc
(http://www.plantcyc.org/databases/aracyc/15.0).
We extracted the pathway information from the biopax-level2.owl
AraCyc pathway IDs and KEGG COMPOUND IDs were extracted. This dataset
contains 268 metabolite sets linked to KEGG COMPOUND IDs. There are only
metabolite sets containing at least 5 compounds.

Description: This package includes metabolite-set data collections that are
        utilized for the Metabolite Set Enrichment Analyses (MSEA) method
        for large-scale metabolite profiles. It includes Ecoli, Human and
        Mouse, and plants of the MetaCyc database (Caspi et al. NAR 
        44:D471-D480, 2016) and SMPDB (Jewison et al. NAR 42: D478-D484, 2014).
